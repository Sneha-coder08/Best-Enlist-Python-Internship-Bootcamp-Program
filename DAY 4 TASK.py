>>> #DAY 4 - PYTHON VARIABLES & DATA TYPES
>>> #EXERCISE
>>> #1)Create three variables (a,b,c) to same value of any integer & do the following a) Divide a by 10 b) Multiply b by 50 c) Add c value by 60
>>> a=b=c=30
>>> print( "The values of a =" ,a, "b =" ,b, "and c =" ,c)
The values of a = 30 b = 30 and c = 30

>>> #a) Divide a by 10
>>> print("Divide a by 10 =",a/10)
Divide a by 10 = 3.0

>>> #b) Multiply b by 50
>>> print("Multiply b by 50 =",b*50)
Multiply b by 50 = 1500

>>> #c) Add c value by 60
>>> print("Add c value by 60 =",c+10)
Add c value by 60 = 40


>>> #2)Create a String variable of 5 characters and replace the 3rd character with G
>>> string_variable="sneha"
>>> print("String before replacing the 3rd character with G =",string_variable)
String before replacing the 3rd character with G = sneha
>>> print("String after replacing the 3rd character with G =",string_variable.replace("e","G"))
String after replacing the 3rd character with G = snGha


>>> #3)Create two values (a,b) of int,float data type & convert the vise versa, Hint : convert a from int to float datatype & b from float to int datatype
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 5.0
>>> print("The value of a before typecasting =",a)
The value of a before typecasting = 5
>>> print("The value of a after typecasting=",float(a))
The value of a after typecasting= 5.0
>>> print("The value of b before typecasting =",b)
The value of b before typecasting = 5.0
>>> print("The value of b after typecasting=",int(b))
The value of b after typecasting= 5
